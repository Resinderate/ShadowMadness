# Shadow Madness

A group project by Ronan Murphy and Aaron Conroy.

SM is a 2D platformer game made in C# / XNA in which we created an
interesting shadow mechanic to add to the traditional content of a platformer.

Released on IndieDB where you can see visual demos, pictures and
also a download to play without compiling the project here.
